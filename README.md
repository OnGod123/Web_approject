This function, render, is designed to render HTML templates with dynamic content in Python. It takes three parameters: template_name, context, and optionally request.

Step 1: Load Template

The function starts by loading the HTML template specified by template_name using the open() function. The template content is then read and stored in the variable template_content.

Step 2: Replace Template Variable

Next, the function iterates through the items in the context dictionary. For each key-value pair in the context, it searches for occurrences of the key enclosed in double curly braces (e.g., {{ key }}) within the template content. If found, it replaces the key with the corresponding value from the context.

Step 3: Handle Special Template Tags

The function then calls handle_special_tags() to handle special template tags such as {{ video }}, {{ image }}, and {{ form }}. These tags represent placeholders for dynamic content like videos, images, or forms. The function replaces these tags with the appropriate HTML elements based on the values provided in the context.

Handle {{ video }}: If the template contains {{ video }}, it replaces it with an HTML <video> tag pointing to the URL provided in the context.
Handle {{ image }}: If the template contains {{ image }}, it replaces it with an HTML <img> tag pointing to the URL provided in the context.
Handle {{ form }}: If the template contains {{ form }} and a request object is provided, it assumes there's a Django form object in the context and replaces the {{ form }} tag with the HTML representation of the form.
Step 4: Return Rendered HTML

Finally, the function returns the rendered HTML content, which includes the original template content with the placeholders replaced by dynamic content.

handle_special_tags(template_content, context, request=None):

This function handles special template tags like {{ video }}, {{ image }}, and {{ form }} by replacing them with the appropriate HTML elements based on the values provided in the context.

Handle {{ video }}: Replaces {{ video }} with an HTML <video> tag pointing to the URL provided in the context.
Handle {{ image }}: Replaces {{ image }} with an HTML <img> tag pointing to the URL provided in the context.
Handle {{ form }}: Replaces {{ form }} with the HTML representation of a Django form object if request is provided.
